# Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Korean)

This repository is for a Korean translation of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/).  
This is inspired by [another Korean tralation repository](https://github.com/carpedm20/neural-networks-and-deep-learning-ko) of [Taehoon Kim](https://github.com/carpedm20).  
I translated the book, following author's comments in [FAQ page](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/faq.html):  
> **I'd like to do a translation into another language. Is that okay?** It's fine under the terms of the book's license (see the page footer for details), provided: (1) you're not doing it for a product which is commercial in some way (e.g., you intend to sell it); and (2) you acknowledge me as the original author.  

And I wrote a translation in `html` for interactive `JavaScript` elements.
